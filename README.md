# nude

Studies have shown that your heart rate increases in a faster rate when you give someone your phone to show an image on your gallery, only for them to start browsing uninvited. You snatch your phone away, hoping they didn’t stumble across one of the intimate photos that may be residing, fully exposed, on your handset. Machine learning may be the solution to this problem, and it comes in the form of a little app called Nude. 

The taking and the storing of explicit photos with a phone is tricky — do it wrong and you may end up sharing a photo with someone you didn’t mean to. Casually leaving these images in your phone’s camera roll is a good way for someone else to accidentally see them, and so the popular option has usually been something like a hidden photos app, a password-protected photo vault, or something like Samsung’s secure folder. 

We propose Nude for Android as something more than just a vault app. To be a better solution than all of the above because it uses machine learning to do most of the work. Machine learning algorithms sort through your phone’s camera roll in search of ones it identifies as nudes. These are automatically grabbed and moved into a private location on the handset, one where snooping kids or a friend without boundaries can’t find them. 

All you have to do is to click on the scan button and wait for Nude to finish scanning the images in your gallery. Once Nude finds an image containing someone who is nude, it prompts the user to confirm whether the photo should be locked away. If confirmed, the image will be shuttled to a private area where it is secured behind a PIN/Biometric. The photo is deleted from the phone’s camera roll, making it more secure but also prone to being lost forever if you misplace the phone.

We have also provided an option of hiding the files manually, in case the user wants to hide something that might not be sensitive in terms of nudity but in terms of value? Ex: a scanned document. In order to provide the user more control over the detection we have provided a configuration panel where the user can adjust the accuracy of the scanning. Also he/she can increase the scan with FastScan option or by choosing a lighter model.

In ‘Nude’ ,we respect everyones right to privacy. We made a fully OFFLINE mobile application which enables the app to run image classification within your phone itself without a servers help (using TensorFlow Lite). This way your data does not leave your phone


We have published a working version of the application in play store a month back. But we are still improving the app. We have started a feedback loop campaign where the users can suggest what changes or features they would like to see on ‘Nude’ app by writing to us. We take user suggestions very seriously. We want to make this app more accurate and simple to use and transparent to every users. 

Some of the new features we are planning to add are,

1. Face recognition to hide your favourite persons videos or photos automatically.
2. Retraining the model based on users feedback on a detected image is really sensitive or not
3. Enhanced UI/UX


For this we are seeking help and guidance. We would really love to work with the experienced developers in google platform. Please let us know if you need any additional information. We are happy to hear from you. Write to us at codepooltech@gmail.com.
